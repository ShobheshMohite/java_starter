// <!-- 2. Explain the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM.
// Example:

// JDK (Java Development Kit): Contains tools for developing, debugging, and monitoring Java applications (e.g., javac, java).
// JRE (Java Runtime Environment): Provides libraries, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components to run applications written in Java.
// JVM (Java Virtual Machine): Abstract machine that enables your computer to run a Java program. -->

// <!-- - JDK includes JRE and development tools.
// - JRE includes JVM and standard libraries.
// - JVM executes Java bytecode. -->
